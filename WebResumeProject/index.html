             I'm Severinus, a dedicated DevOps Engineer and web developer with a strong focus on building reliable, scalable, and efficient systems. My expertise lies in automating workflows, managing cloud infrastructure, and implementing CI/CD pipelines to streamline software delivery. I am passionate about bridging the gap between development and operations, ensuring smooth deployments and robust application performance. Alongside my DevOps work, I enjoy crafting user-friendly websites and continuously learning new technologies. I believe in leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and drive innovation. And last but not least, I am a proud father of two. I enjoy playing sports/watching Soccer and reading books.
