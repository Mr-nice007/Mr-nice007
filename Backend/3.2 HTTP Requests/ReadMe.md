# HTTP Requests Project

This project demonstrates how to work with HTTP requests in a backend environment. It covers the basics of sending and handling HTTP requests using popular Node.js libraries.

## Features

- Sending GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests
- Handling responses and errors
- Working with JSON data
- Example code snippets
- HTTP requests is use to communicate between the client-side and the server-side.
- 
- Create a directory call 3.2 http request
- create a file called index.js 
- initialise NPM ( npm init -y)
- Install the Express package (npm i express)
- write Server application in index.js
- start Server (nodemon index.js)
- install nodemon package to restart server automatically whenerver they're changes in the code directory or index.js file (npm i nodemon)

## HTTP Requests
- GET: GET is used to retrieve and request data from a specified resource in a server.
