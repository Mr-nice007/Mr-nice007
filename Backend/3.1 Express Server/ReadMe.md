- NodeJs is a runtime Env that allows javascript to run on any server or computer.
- Express.js is a framework ontop of node.js which is use to write the backend application.
- backend is also known as the server-side
   - Server: which is the computer/server which host the application
   - Application: which is the application logic/code written in express.js
   - Database: which is the store for user data/ persisted user data
- Front-end: which is also known as the client-side

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a basic Express.js server setup using Node.js. It covers the foundational concepts of backend development, including server configuration, application logic, and database integration. The goal is to provide a simple starting point for building RESTful APIs or web applications.

## Features

- Simple Express.js server
- Modular code structure for scalability
- Clear separation between server, application logic, and database
- Ready for further extension with routes, middleware, and database models
